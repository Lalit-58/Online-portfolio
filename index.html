    <section id="About">
        <p>Hi, I am Doki Lalit Aditya, a passionate learner driven by the excitement of acquiring new skills and exploring the world of technology. I  always strive to broaden my perspective and understanding. My enthusiasm for learning fuels my work, keeping me motivated to grow and contribute meaningfully in everything I do.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of coding, I have a deep love for sports and gaming. I actively play badminton, which keeps me physically fit and calms my mind. As a hardcore gamer, I immerse myself in dynamic virtual worlds, finding both relaxation and inspiration through the challenges they offer. 
            Balancing these interests helps me stay energized, focused, and ready to take on new opportunities.
